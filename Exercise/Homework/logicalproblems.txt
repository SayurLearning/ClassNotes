1. Write an app for the follwoing two player game. You have a 6 x 6 board. 
Users take turns rolling the dice twice. first roll is row no, second roll is col number. Mark the spot (row, col) as claimed by the user
who rolled the dice.
When the user rolls the dice within 1 col/row of a claimed spot of the other user, the other user gets a point. 
If the spot is same as the claimed spot of the other user, the user that rolled the dice gets a point. 
The player who gets 5 points first wins the game. 

2. You have a message that you want to send to your friend. You don't want others to see the message. You code the message and send it.
The alg to code is - split each word in half and reverse it (eg cricket becomes ketccri), if the word ends with a vowel, split at the 
last letter and reverse (eg cinema becomes acinem), if the word has numbers, spell the number but add A as first and last letters
 (8 pm becomes AeightA pm ).
 Write an app that can code and decode the message.
