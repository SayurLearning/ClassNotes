1. Google and Find out about 5 different public APIs (in different catagories) and write how they are used by applications.
    eg - https://shrouded-falls-48764.herokuapp.com/docs/readme.html - 
        this API returns the details of car. We can use this to see when the car's insurance is expiring.
2. Write five of your own use cases for what API should be created and how it can be used.
    eg - API to show which stop the bus is (input is bus number). Students can use it to plan 
    when to leave home to take that bus.
3. Learn about JSON. Write the a sample output for the usecases you came up with (in question number 2)
   in JSON
