Use For loop to go over a string

1. Get a city name from the user. Find out how many 'a' or 'e' is in the city name
2. Get a movie name. Find out how many words are in that movie. 
3. Get a name. Replace all the 'a' with 'c'. Print the name. 
4. Get two names. If the length of the two names is not equal, add 'a' at the end of the short name
    until the length is equal. 
    Eg - input - cat, arrow. (legnth is not equal) 
    Output - cataa, arrow (length is equal by adding a)

5. Same program as above. Instead of adding 'a' at the end of the short name, add the last letter.
    Eg - input - cat, arrow. (legnth is not equal) 
    Output - cattt, arrow (length is equal by adding the last letter of Cat)
