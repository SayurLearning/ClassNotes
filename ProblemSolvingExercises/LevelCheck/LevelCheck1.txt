1.Spiderman wants to go from Madurai to Chennai. As you all know, he can jump from a tall 
building to another tall building. He likes to post a picture of the building he is jumping 
to on Instagram every time he jumps. He needs to make sure he has enough energy to jump 
before every jump. He drinks coffee to get more energy.
Spiderman can jump only if the distance between two tall buildings is one km or less.
 If it is more than one km, he has to take a bus from the nearby bus station.
  He stops every 10km to see if there is a tall building.

Write a flowchart to show how spiderman can go from Madurai to Chennai.

2.Get a number from the user. Divide it by 3 and print the result. 
Divide again by 3 and print the result. Keep dividing until the number is less than 3. 
Print the number of times the number was divided. 

3.Get two names. If the length of the two names is not equal, add 'a' at the end of the short name
    until the length is equal. 
    Eg - input - cat, arrow. (legnth is not equal) 
    Output - cataa, arrow (length is equal by adding a)

4.Encoding problem - Input is a message and  a pattern. Both strings. Output is the message written in the form
of the pattern. 
Eg -  Message - "I Love India".
      Pattern - "*** **** ** **********     *****"
      Output  - "ILo veIn di aILoveIndi     aILov"

     Note how you replace each * in the pattern with the letter in the message, the space in the message doesn't
     matter, but the space(s) in the pattern matters.
5. Input is a sentence. Find the number of times each word appears.
