Do not use any built in functions. Use for/while loops as needed.
You can hard code an array with 10 or more  elements (numbers or strings as needed)
 in your code. No need to get input.

1. Find the average of numbers in an array.


2. Find the longest and shortest word in an array of words.

3. Find count of words that are atleast two chars longer than the smallest word in an array.

4. Separate all even and odd numbers in one array into two different arrays. 
    Find the max and min from each array. Do not use any built in functions. 

5. Sort an array with 3 elements in ascending order.

6. Sort and array with 10 elements in descending order. 
 (hint - you will be using two for loops. First find the largest number,
  then find the next largest number etc).
