Decide what will be input for each of these questions, before starting to write code.

1. Calculate the salary for the phone salesman. Base pay is Rs10000. 
Based on the years of experience of the saleman the basepay increses.
Rs 2000 will be added for each year of experience.
For every 10 phones sold, he gets 13% of the base pay as commission.

2. Same as above. For eacy day the salesman doesn't go to work, subtract Rs200 from the total pay.

3. Same as above, but there is a change in the way commission is calculated.
For the first 10 phones sold, commission is 13%, for the next 10 phones sold, it is 15%, 
and one percent increse for every 5 phones sold after that. 
(Hint -  write down the percent of commission for different number of phones sold and 
understand the problem,  before writing the  program)
