1. This is a game for two users. Each user takes turn rolling the dice. 
Dice values can be 1 to 6. If the user rolls 1,4,6 he gets a point and 
another chance to roll 
If the user gets a point three times in a row, then he gets 5 additional points. 
Each user can play a maximum of 50 times. 
The user that takes max point wins. 

2. Same game as above. Add an additional condition to subtract one point when the user rolls 5. 
If the user rolls 2, then he will miss a turn. 

3. Calculate the angle between the big hand and small hand in a clock.
 The user will input the numbers that the hands are pointing to.
