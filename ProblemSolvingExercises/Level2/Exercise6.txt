1. Write a program for a  vegetable store. 
Create a dictionary to maintain the food name and price per 100 grams.
Input from the user will be in the format Food:amount units
(for eg Tomato:2 Kg 
or Tomato: 200 gms). User will give many input. When the user input is 'That's it', 
find the total cost. 

2. Same as above. Add one more property to each food item. It is 'Quantity available'. eg 5 kg
Update this property every time the sale is made. At the end of each customer sale, print 
the inventory (the dictionary). You should print in the following format.
"4.5 kg tomota is available
 3 kg Onion is available
 300 gms Chilli is available"

 Write your function to do the printing.
 
3. Same as above. You also need list all the sales by customer in a day and  print what is the
max amount of sale.
